# weather-dashboard

## Description
This is the sixth challenge of the UC Berkeley Web Development bootcamp in which we were challenged to create from scratch an interactive weather app that can utilize openweathermap api to retrieve the local weather conditions and five day forecast for a city searched for by the user. 

## Installation 
N/A

## Usage
Once the user has navigated to the webpage they will see a few elements on the page. A text input box, prompting them to search for a specific city, as well as a dropdown menu that allows the user to select the country their desired city is in to ensure accuracy. If the country is the US a new dropdown menu will appear and give the user the ability to select the correct state as well. 

If the user fails to enter a city in the search bar before hitting the search button an error message will appear. If the user mistypes the city name a different error message will appear prompting the user to try again. Upon a successful city search the current weather conditions for that city will be generated as well as a five day forecast. The five most recent successful searches are stored locally and represented by buttons that the user can quickly click to reload the weather conditions for that previously searched city. The use is also provided an option to clear their search history if they so desire. 

## Credits
This code was written by William Weaver. In some areas I heavily borrowed from my own code used in previous assignments including the group project. I also received some assistance from classmate John Owed with the api calls.
